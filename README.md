INSTRUCTIONS
1. You need to put the repository to the htdocs from XAMPP. The url to see the repo is http://localhost:80/Timetable-App-P6/
2. Remember that first you need to add the SQL from the campus to a database that you should name "timetable_db".
3. After that, go to http://localhost:80/Timetable-App-P6/db_connection.php, if you see in the browser the message "Success connecting to db" then it means that the database connection is correct!
